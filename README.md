## Overview

Customer support teams often receive a large volume of emails covering various topics. Manually categorizing these emails is time-consuming and inefficient. This project leverages a pre-trained language model to automatically classify emails into predefined categories, enhancing the efficiency of the support team.

## Dataset

This project uses the Enron Email Dataset as a starting point. The dataset needs to be cleaned and labeled manually before training the model. You can download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wcukierski/enron-email-dataset).
